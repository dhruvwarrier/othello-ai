# othello-ai
A somewhat AI that plays the board game Othello.

A basic "AI" that plays the board game Othello by looking 4 moves into the future, assuming that the player always plays a greedy move. Black always plays first. Future implementations may include a Mimimax algorithm or an RNN (Recurrent Neural Network).

The program contains both the AI program and some basic UI to draw boards and interact with the AI via command-line, so the game can be played.
